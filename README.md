# FilterDesign
This project is about designing a low pass filter in MATLAB, to be later implemented on the Adruino Due platform.
The goal was to get used to MATLAB, designing methods, and the Fourier Transform computation.

## How does it work ?
Launch the file [FilterDesign](FilterDesign.m) with MATLAB_R2021b.

Running the code will not display anything.
The plots are written in code comment. Read the file and remove the '%' before the line you want to display.
Hit the "Run" button.

## MATLAB
This project was done using MATLAB_R2021b.

## Collaborators
